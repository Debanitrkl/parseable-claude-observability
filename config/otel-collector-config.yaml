# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for sending telemetry to Parseable
#
# This config is designed to be used as an overlay with the OTel Demo's
# default collector configuration. Copy this file to:
#   opentelemetry-demo/src/otelcollector/otelcol-config-extras.yaml
#
# Or use it as a standalone config for your own OTel Collector deployment.
